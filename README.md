## Version 4
Version 4. The current version of the bot.

## Get this version goin'!
Eh... you can run this. Run `start.sh` or `start.bat` from `src` folder. It is not optimized to run like v5 does.

## Contributing
Don't. Unless you really want to ig. This version will be decommissioned once stable v5 is released.
